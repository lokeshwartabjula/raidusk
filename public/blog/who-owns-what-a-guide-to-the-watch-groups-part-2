<p>Every so often the landscape of the watch industry shifts: a key brand gets sold to a major watch group and the balance of power changes ever so slightly. In the last few years, some important changes in the big groups' holdings have occurred: Harry Winston joined the Swatch Group, Kering acquired Ulysse Nardin, and both Citizen Group and Citychamp have made inroads into the Swiss watch world.</p>
<p>Here are the group rosters of brands:</p>

Seiko produces all the components used in both its mechanical and its quartz watches. While it is known primarily for the Seiko brand of watches, the group also makes high-end mechanicals under Grand Seiko (which it launched on the U. S. market in 2010) and a variety of offerings through its other brands. </p>

<p>Citychamp Watch & Jewellery Group Limited, formerly known as China Haidian, has recently become a force on the international watch scene. The Hong Kong-based company has a strong position in the Chinese market with its brands Rossini and Ebohr. But in the last few years it has begun to acquire international brands as well. They include the Swiss brands Corum, which Citychamp purchased in 2013, and Eterna, acquired in 2011. Last year, Citychamp acquired the Swiss Dreyfuss Group and its brands, including Rotary.</p>
<p>Citychamp is a public company. In 2013 it had revenues of 3.176 billion Hong Kong dollars ($409.8 million U. S.). At the end of 2013, the group had approximately 3,000 employees in Greater China and 200 in Switzerland.
